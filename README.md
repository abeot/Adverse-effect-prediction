# Adverse-effect-prediction

This is the source code for [Machine Learning Prediction of On/Off Target-driven Clinical Adverse Events](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-024-03742-x).

The code for the final model we used for predictions is contained in `AE_train_1.py` in the `code` folder.
A.C. and Y.Z. worked together on `AE_train_1.py`, `utils.py`, and `ml_utils.py`. 

The original data comes from the files `all_grades.tsv`, `drug_cid.tsv`, `normal_tissue.tsv`,
`proteinatlas.tsv`, `uniprotkb_reviewed_true_AND_model_organ_2023_08_23.tsv`. These
datasets were acquired from various sources referenced in the paper.
